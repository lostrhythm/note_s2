    generate training set - manually label small part, then use semi-supervised approach to enlarge the set  
        cooccurance of words to label the sentence  
    fastText - classifies the context to tell if the context in which the target term has the target meaning 
    RNN - fix the imbalance problem

## Idea  
1. Google API to get the negative samples  
2. tweet to get the positive samples  
3.  
    1. cleaning the $ tag and lower all cases
    2. if the text contain the targets  
    3. ticker classification -> context classification  
        use RNN to do the classification?
