    with drop out the J is different as the network is different
    then, the gradient checking technique is not suitable to compute here
    so, do gradient checking first, when find no problem, turn on the drop out

# 29/05/2018
# https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/81oTm/why-does-batch-norm-work
    batch norm reduce the previous layers parameters changes leading to the current activation units change too much, 
    then the performance of the NN will be impacted, as the new distribution is not familiar to the NN
    
    boost the independence between different layers, speed up the learning speed? how?
        # so as to have bigger slope of the g

    add noise to hidden layers, make the dependence weaker, not strongly rely on some specific hidden unit,
    thus slight regularization effect
    
        as bigger mini batch size lead to smaller noise on mean and var,
        thus wierd:
            bigger batch weaker regularization effect

# https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/HRy7y/softmax-regression
    why not just trivial logistic regression, and normalize among all the output units
    softmax is function of vector, instead of sigle value like ReLU or logistic regression


# https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/LCsCH/training-a-softmax-classifier
    hardmax
        max with 1,
        others with 0
        
    when c == 2, softmax == logistic
        
    softmax loss function does not use (1-y)log y  to deal with the negative example, 
    is because, there is the constraint on sum(Y) = 1, as long as the prob corresponding to 1
    is big, the prob corresponding to 0 is small

# https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/l9zia/multi-task-learning
    the main difference between softmax and multi-task
        multi-task is using the combination of logistic regressions,
            1 image multi-labels
            allow multiple 1 in output label
            when the images are not fully labeled, denote the unchecked label dimension with "?",
            then at the final output we can just skip the "?"s when calculate the loss  
        softmax
            1 image sigle-label
            only allow sigle 1 in output label
            
            
both transfer learning and multi-task learning, it seems need much more auxiliary data than the explicit data,
why? will not lead to bias??

    calculate based on the shallower layers of CNN, it demands more detailed similarity
    calculate based on the deeper layers of CNN, it only demands the topic is identical, like both dogs
    
    similar with the face recognization approach, use the distance between two images to form the cost function?
    
    the generation is the a[l](g), which is tuned by changing the weight? so in order to change the figure, 
    in fact is still changing the network

    define the "style" of an image as 
        correlation between activations across channels
    different channels of a intermediate layer, denote different features, corresponding to different filters
    
    correlation,
        denotes different features are occuring together or not together often
        
    J(S) is based on the style matrix, style matrix is based on the correlation 
        (which in fact is unnormalized corvariance, multiply the corresponding elements of different channel)
        
        
# https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/lecture/OkHJ3/1d-and-3d-generalizations
    1D 3D data are both having the channels
        2D 2*3*3 != 3D 2*3*3
        as 3D 2*3*3 is in fact 2*3*3*1

    transfer learning and word embedding
        transfer learning not necessarily reuse the parameters of NN
        may be just make use of the pre-trained word embeddings
        
    word embedding is train on the fixed sized vocabulary, and only limit words has the new representation,
    in face recognization, any new figs could be represented as new representation.

    the parallelogram relationship hold true only in the original space, instead of in the T-SNE space
        T-SNE is non-linear
        
        
# https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models/lecture/K604Z/embedding-matrix
    word embeddings are learnt in a matrix E
    use look up function embedding layer to pull out the new representation from E, 
    instead of using the matrix multiplication
