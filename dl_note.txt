two side approximation is more accurate than the one side approx

gradient check
    reshape the parameters 
    d_parameters 
        into big vector
        do numercial approx 
        on each dimension
        to get theta_approx
        
    check the approximationality between theta_approx and theta
        use cos similarity
            normalization with the length of theta_approx and theta

    with drop out the J is different as the network is different
    then, the gradient checking technique is not suitable to compute here
    so, do gradient checking first, when find no problem, turn on the drop out
    
xavier initialization
    used for making the wx not too big or too small, so that the g(wx) has the big slope, then make the optimazation faster,
        tanh : np.sqrt(1 / n)
            # xavier
        ReLU : np.sqrt(2 / n)

        single pass through the training set

    stochastic gradient descent
        mini batch size == 1
        
    typical batch size

    moving average
        exponentially weighted average, 
        reason it called "exponentially", is because the "feedback" structure, exponential filter
        
        
        
        
# https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/y0m1f/gradient-descent-with-momentum
    using exponentially weighted average to build a better optimization algorithm
        calculating the exponentially weight of the gradient, 
        use this gradient to update the gradients
        
    reduce the speed onsome specific direction
    
    momentum, 
        # df: use the previous speed direction as component of current one, once find a direction, keep go along it for some extent
        here is using average to smooth directions,
            so that direction with more ocileration is slown down
            the direction with less ocilleration is fasteren up

    RMSprop
        root mean squre properation
        not using the S_w directly
        
        
# https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/w9VCZ/adam-optimization-algorithm
    adam
        adaptive moment estimation
            = momentum + RMSprop
                # divide the momentum by the RMSprop
        
        
# https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/RFANA/the-problem-of-local-optima
    momentum
    RMSprop
    Adam
        are all for speed up the algorithm, by allowing to use the big learning rate
        which is important to overcome the plateau problem

    batch normalization
        # local nomalization?
        make it easier for hyperparameters search
        
        not for normalization a mini batch
        instead it normalize the z
        
# https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/RN8bN/fitting-batch-norm-into-a-neural-network
    reason called batch norm
        using with the mini batch, instead of the batch gradient
        but in fact no difference of the mechanism, only using the different mean and variance
