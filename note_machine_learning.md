dimension expanding
    
    scr = sc[None,:]

to see if the model is correct

    print(str(lr.coef_))


mangnitude of gradient porpotional to learning rate  
gradient magnitude is the learning rate  
    gradient value is the changing rate  
    gradient direction is the fastest changing direction  
    
learning rate getting big + ,  
    derivative +, means function getting big 
a lot of things to learn  
tune step bigger

learning rate getting small - ,  
    derivative -, means function getting small
few things to learn  
tune step small
