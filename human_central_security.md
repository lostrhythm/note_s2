Usable Security

    - https://www.coursera.org/learn/usable-security
        This course focuses on how to design and build secure systems with a 
        -human-centric focus. 
        We will look at basic principles of human-computer interaction, 
        and apply these insights to the design of secure systems 
        with the goal of developing security measures that 
        respect human performance and their goals within a system.
